abstract: 
  Data-driven approaches applied to research in the humanities offer extensive opportunities to analyze large volumes of data and gain new knowledge and insights. Web archives serve as valuable resources for analysis of the development of the websites and even the entire domains through the decades, providing access to historical data. This research focuses on applying data-driven approaches to the web history of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the National Museum of Australia. Utilizing the Internet Archive and the Australian Web Archive, the study examines the opportunities and challenges in extracting and analyzing large datasets from these sources. Key challenges include the complexities of obtaining datasets, dealing with incomplete or biased data, and the inherent difficulties in analyzing diverse data formats like text, images, and multimedia. The research highlights the importance of digital research infrastructures, such as the GLAM Workbench and Archives Research Compute Hub, in addressing these challenges and facilitating robust analysis. The study demonstrates the potential of data-driven methodologies to offer new insights into the evolution of museums' online presence while also underscoring the complexities involved in the research process.
key-points:
  - Data-driven research offers significant opportunities for analyzing large volumes of web archived data to reveal trends in the complexity of the structure of the preserved websites and the development of content.
  - Implementation of data-driven research in web history is challenging due to issues like data incompleteness, biases, and the diversity of file formats, which require the development of innovative solutions and digital research infrastructures.
  - The research highlights challenges in obtaining comprehensive datasets from web archives, underscores the importance of assessing data quality, and indicates the need to address the heterogeneous nature of data preserved in web archives.

## Quarto Usage

For advanced users, we recommend exploring features as **Code Blocks**: Use triple backticks (```) to create code blocks. Specify the language for syntax highlighting (e.g., ```python`). Quarto lets you run code and embed its output directly into your document. See <https://quarto.org/docs/computations/inline-code.html> for guidance.

```{python}
#| output: false
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Create some simple synthetic historical data
np.random.seed(0)
years = pd.date_range('1900-01-01', periods=120, freq='Y')
values = np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=1, size=120).cumsum()

data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Year': years.year,
    'Value': values
})

# Save the data to a CSV file
data.to_csv('data/sample_data.csv', index=False)
```

```{python}
#| label: fig-plots
# Plotting the data
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(data['Year'], data['Value'], marker='o')
plt.title('Synthetic Historical Data')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Value')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```
